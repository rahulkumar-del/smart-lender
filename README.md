# SmartLender - Loan Eligibility Prediction System Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Summary

SmartLender is a Machine Learning-based loan eligibility prediction system developed to automate the preliminary loan screening process. Instead of manually reviewing every loan application, the system analyzes applicant information such as gender, marital status, education, self-employment status, applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, loan amount term, credit history, and property area using trained machine learning models and predicts whether the applicant is eligible for a loan.

Rather than replacing loan officers, SmartLender acts as an intelligent decision-support tool that enables faster, more consistent, and transparent lending decisions.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The project follows a modular three-layer architecture.

### Machine Learning Layer

Handles data preprocessing, missing value handling, feature encoding, model training, model evaluation, and model selection.

Algorithms Used:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost

Random Forest is selected as the final prediction model based on its higher accuracy.

### Backend Layer

Implemented using Flask.

Handles:

- HTTP Requests
- User Input Processing
- Machine Learning Model Loading
- Loan Prediction
- Result Generation

### Presentation Layer

Built using:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Jinja2 Templates

Provides a clean and responsive web interface for users to enter loan details and receive prediction results.

# 🚀 How to Run the Application

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher installed
- pip package manager
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

---

## Step 1: Navigate to the Project Folder

The complete source code of the application is located inside the **SmartLender_Project_codes** directory.

```bash
cd SmartLender_Project_codes
```

---

## Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Install all required Python libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 3: Generate Machine Learning Model

Execute the machine learning pipeline.

```bash
python model.py
```

This process loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains multiple machine learning models, compares their performance, selects the Random Forest model, and saves the trained model as **loan_model.pkl**.

---

## Step 4: Launch the Flask Web Application

Start the server using:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## Step 5: Open the Application

Visit the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 🧪 Testing (Optional)

The application has been tested using multiple loan applicant records to verify prediction accuracy and functionality.

Testing Includes:

- Functional Testing
- User Interface Testing
- Prediction Testing
- Input Validation
